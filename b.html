Friday, August 15th, 2003. 10 o'clock PM EST (7 o'clock PM PST). Dark night (#2E2E2E, https://www.color-hex.com/color/2e2e2e) and a moon whole (#F3F3F3, https://www.color-hex.com/color/f3f3f3)
 I wandered to the retention pond (Lat: 28.688283, Long: -81.459296), murky water (approx #004931, https://www.color-hex.com/color/004931) whereupon 
 I stumbled a noise beckon'd (https://i.imgur.com/pWQxvs9.png, https://youtu.be/MO2_dn19zCA?t=20) my ears perked, a noise unknown to me, that time (August 15, 2003; approx 22:05 EST, 
 19:05 PST) present. My age: 9 years, 2 months, 9 days, 17 hours and 13 minutes. Skin on my feet (approx #FDF2E4, https://www.color-hex.com/color/fdf2e4) sank in mud. 
 My heart, palpitating (135 BPM, approx. 2 asynchronous beats per. 5 seconds) at delights of prospects of losing my virginity. My first orgasm was on June 3rd, 2003 at around 2 PM EST (11 AM PST)
  my age was 8 years, 11 months, 19 days, 11 hours and 30 minutes assuming my time of birth was June 15th, 1994 at 2:30 AM EST (June 14th, 1994 at 11:30 PM PST) this masturbatory act transpired 
  in a hot tub. The details of this encounter are unimportant. I pludged the depths, paddling across at a rate of 3 MPH (2.6 knots) swampy water 
  beading my face and hair (#694600, https://www.color-hex.com/color/694600) Fruitless efforts, as I attempted to pinpoint the source of my curiosity. 
  Finally: a lilypad (#00640D, https://www.color-hex.com/color/00640d) (approx 11 inches [27.94 cm] wide) held my prize. One adult, male "rana catesbeiana" (Common American Bullfrog) 
  it's size (about 7.5 inches wide [19.05 cm], 9 inches long [22.86 cm], 2.3 inches tall [5.842 cm] weighing approximately 100 grams [0.22 pounds]) typical for that of this species, 
  I've discovered. I snatched it, it put up no fight. I hurried back to shore (approx. 3.5 MPH, [3.04 knots]) wherein my eyes (#009313, https://www.color-hex.com/color/009313) 
  gleamed upon sight of this trepid creature. I decided to pull down my
   jean shorts (#000E82, https://www.color-hex.com/color/000e82) and my underwear (#C2C2C2, https://www.color-hex.com/color/c2c2c2). 
   I parted it's lips (#00E71E, https://www.color-hex.com/color/009313) and placed my member (Head: #C23899, https://www.color-hex.com/color/c23899; 
   Shaft: #E5BF9E ALPHA:217, https://www.color-hex.com/color/e5bf9e) inside. I thrusted, he croaked. I finish, my seed (#E0E0E0 ALPHA: 155, https://www.color-hex.com/color/e0e0e0) 
   seeped from his oriface. I toss him back towards the sea, and proceeded back home.
