COBOL thru CGI. HTML is transposed in my COBOL-ified pseudo-HTML. Most syntax remains identifiable to HTML, but I made some changes to suit my tastes (LINEAGE is one.)

DICTIONARY.CPY contains the HTML copybook, take it if you want for some reason :)

COBOL allows dynamic apps through CGI, so there's possibility for cool stuff down the line in that regard!
