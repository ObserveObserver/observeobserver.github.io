COBOL thru CGI. HTML is transposed in my COBOL-ified pseudo-HTML. Syntax is identifiable to HTML equivalents (I think anyway,) but I made some changes to suit my tastes and many sensible ones had to be discarded due to COBOL's abundance of reserved keywords (CLASS->LINEAGE is one.) Syntactically, I tried to make it "flow" in English, as COBOL does. The lack of adverbs (as they were all taken by COBOL itself) made this extremely difficult.

DICTIONARY.CPY contains the HTML copybook, take it if you want for some reason :)

COBOL allows dynamic apps through CGI, so there's possibility for cool stuff down the line in that regard!
