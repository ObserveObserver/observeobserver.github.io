Uses an old version of [idris2-blizzard-html](https://github.com/joshua-obritsch/idris2-blizzard-html) because the new one doesn't work. finnicky library for sure.

Jus staticly generates the site, I like functional HTML and I find myself more and more needing Script. I could use markdown and I WILL add markdown support at some point but I really don't care right now :)
