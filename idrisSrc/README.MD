Uses an old version of [idris2-blizzard-html](https://github.com/joshua-obritsch/idris2-blizzard-html/) because the new one doesn't work (at least for me!) finnicky library for sure, but it's actually nice! it does what i need it to. if i need more, i'll upgrade and fix the new version ("toString --> interpolate" update seems to have messed things up)

Jus staticly generates the site, I like functional HTML and I find myself more and more needing Script. I could use markdown and I WILL add markdown support at some point but I really don't care right now :)

typing is not great (String -> String vs Title -> Content) but ill deal with it later, i jus wanted to get it to work. :)
