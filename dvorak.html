Welcome to my keyboard blog, I really like keyboards and layouts. Here, I will write a bit about layouts, experiences, new keyboards
                                what-have-you. I hope you like it!<br >
<br >
Using programmer dvorak for 2 years, I've realized it's simply not for me; and that's okay. Too many people dismiss the idea
                                of simply abandoning a layout if it doesn't fit them or "flow" right. I will write more sometime about this "flow" as it's something 
                                I promised to do a long time ago.<br >
<br >
I started dvorak about 2 years ago and quickly switched to programmer, mostly because of the number system. I came to really, really
                                love the symbols as well and think it is a huge benefit (especially when using a lisp.) I liked the layout a lot, but something
                                never felt quite right. Let me get into what I liked about dvorak:<br >
<br >
<b>The Good:</b><br >
<br >
<code>1. Nice rolls. Dvorak is an alteration layout, but has some of the best short rolls out there (i.e. th ch gh ns nt gh)<br >
<br >
2. Portability. It's everywhere, even on my old Alphasmart I used in school!<br >
<br >
3. It's a good layout overall. Really, it is. It has some problems I think, some bad ones too; but it's a fine layout.<br >
<br >
4. Punctuation on qwerty QWE. One of my favorite things about the layout!</code><br >
<br >
<b>The Bad:</b><br >
<br >
<code>1. L and R are on terrible fingers. This is really inexcusible imo, and there's nothing to defend it.<br >
<br >
2. Overuse of right-hand. Right hand is overused in keypresses and distance dramatically. My righthand sucks (bad genetic rng) so it sucks for me.<br >
<br >
3. It just doesn't feel right to me. This is a combination of lots of things, but it just doesn't feel right to me...</code><br >
<br >
Short blog to start it off, but just my reasons why I am not a fan of Dvorak. If it works for you, I'm happy; it just didn't for me.<br >
<br >
I will stick with it for the time being, and see if it becomes more comfortable!</p></div>
