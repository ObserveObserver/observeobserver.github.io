Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd"<br>

it eats and shits.<br>
it bites your head. it bites your head clean off. it bites your head clean off, the blood pools.<br>
the blood pools around you. the blood pools around you and your last vision is the esophagus of (IT).<br>
(IT) consumes you. (IT) consumes you, you meld. you meld, you finally understand.<br>
[[IT]] fucks you violently. you understand, lucid, clear-minded. you accept it. you want it.<br>
it's what you've always wanted.<br>
{{IT}} feeds. not on your blood, it feeds inversely.<br>
it fills you. it replaces what it needs to.<br>
it tinkers, it's a craftsman.<br>
it replaces your urges, it replaces your fears, it replaces your desires.<br>
you're lucid. you smile. you grimace. both, inbetween; simultaneously./(?)<br>
it's unbound.<br></P></DIV></BODY>
